This repo is a copy of the following [repo](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/blob/adcf5ba/examples/file-upload-html-form/main.c#L34-L35) with minor changes so that I can integrate this into my later projects. More detail can be found from the official Mongoose [website](https://mongoose.ws/documentation/tutorials/file-uploads/).
